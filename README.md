# PArthENoPE_stiff

The original PArthENoPE 3.0 code is modified to accommodate new ingredients of Beyond-Standad-Model physics, which include:
1. A dark radiation component parametrized by the effective number of relativistic species, **$\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$**.
2. A stiff component (with equation of state $w=1$) parametrized by the ratio to photons at 10 MeV, **$\kappa_{10}$**.

Some of the key nuclear reaction rates are also updated, which affect the primordial helium and deuterium abundances.

For documatation of the original PArthENoPE 3.0 code, see the README_parthenope.md file.
